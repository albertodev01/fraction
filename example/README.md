This is a very simple Dart command line app that analyzes fractions and mixed fractions. You can run it using

```bash
 $ dart run
```

inside the `example` folder. If you want to create a portable binary file of this example (like an `.exe` file for Windows), see the [dart compile](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-compile) documentation for more info!
